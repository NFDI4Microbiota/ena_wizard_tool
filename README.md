# ENA Automatic Submission System

This system aims to **automate the validation and submission of metadata and sequencing data** to the **European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)**, following the metadata standards defined by the **MIXS specification**.

## Features

* **Metadata validation**:

  * Date format verification (ISO 8601).
  * Expected value checks and unit validation.
  * Controlled vocabulary and ontology validation (e.g., ENVO, CHEBI, NCBI Taxonomy).

* **Automated submission**:

  * Upload of metadata and sequencing data files.
  * Integration with the ENA submission API (planned for future phases).

## Initial Scope

In its initial version, this system supports only **Terrestrial metadata**.

The metadata fields and requirements are based on the MIXS specification and are described below.

## Future Work

* Expansion to other MIXS packages (e.g., host-associated, built environment).
* Full ENA submission automation (metadata XML generation, file uploads).
* GUI interface for simplified data upload.
